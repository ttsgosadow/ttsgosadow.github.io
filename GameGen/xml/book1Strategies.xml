      <em>Victory Points</em><br />
      At the end of every Turn, after the first, a Crew earns 1 VP if it killed or sacrificed two or more enemy models during that Turn.<br /><br />
      At the end of every Turn after the first, if a player has no models in play (buried models are not considered "in play") then her opponent earns 1 VP. A player may not earn more than 1 VP from this Strategy per Turn.
